With the Transformer removed, it meant I could still get power to the dual psus on the back. Also with the monitor's disabled I was able to use a VGA adapter.

Picture was there at the start and then faded. :(

Decided to go for the compure replacement route initially to at least get something working with the hardware. 
I'll hopefully revisit the original hardware at another time.
