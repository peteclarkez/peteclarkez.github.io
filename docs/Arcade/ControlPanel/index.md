# Control Panel

## Introduction

This was my first test of arcade components.
I built a box from MDF and used the parts that would later go into the Mame Build (see other links).

Later I deceided to reuse the Box to create a retroPi machine and embed that into the box as well so it now breaks out onto a TV via HDMI.

THis is a simple box of 18mm MDF. It had no bottom. I used the parts that would later go into the Mame Build (see other links).

It had a long USB cable that ran to a computer running Mame (or other emulators)

I later deceided to reuse the Box to create a retroPi machine and embed that into the box as well so it now breaks out onto a TV via HDMI.

It used cheaper components (I think it's a set from AliExpress).
It has a Pi3 + Also has led drivers in it. A Powered USB hub is used to provide power to the pi (via back charge) + the led circuit.

There is an external panel which has a USB for Power, HDMI for the TV, and another USB for the RasPi (when you need a keyboard)
