Donor Laptop A Dell Vostro 1710 laptop provided the internals for the build and the cab was built around that. It provided the core dimensions. It's a Core 2 Duo with 4 GB of RAM and an Intel Integrated Video Card. Image below shows some early experiments in order to make sure I could power the laptop on and off from an external button. I had always planned to detach the screen and body, but once I got it open, there wasn't much length to the cable joining the 2 halves, although the screen itself had some very useful mounting holes which take a 3.5mm bolt. This was how i mounted it to the front panel. In the end it was relatively simple and the board had some nice large contacts I could use to attach the wires for a normal arcade button. Cabinet Once I had a width I looked at the cabinet. I went with a width of 500mm and I built a test Control panel to make sure it was enough for 2 players. (Now painted bright yellow and refitted with some cheap buttons and a an internal raspberry pi) I got the layout from here << INSERT LINK >> I used Google Sketchup to plan the build and started into it back in 2013. The SketchUp File is available here on sketchup or for downloading the skp file here It was easy to build the unit but once I got to that stage I got stuck on how to mount a monitor to a front panel. (and left this for about 4 years continually moving this around the garage) Eventually I got a head of steam up to tackle this and spend some time on the software getting the laptop up and running. I also went for the front panel, using 9mm MDF and routing out the opening using paper templates. I also worked out a way to mount the laptop within the cabinet keeping it close to the screen. I used 2 cross bars and the insert removed on the 9mm panel to create an angled shelf to hold the laptop so the cable would reach. I attached velcro patches to the laptop and shelf and this is all that's need to keep it in place. With the plan all done, i got to priming and paint the cabinet. I went for a gray base primer all over to keep dust down and then applied black glass spray paint up in a number of layers with sanding in between. I had toyed with T-molding, but my router has an 8mm socket (got it second hand and think it came from Aldi) so not easy to find a suitable slot cutter. In hindsight I wish I'd at least routed a bevel on the side panels. At this stage it was easy to start assembling the cabinet. I sued a 4 gang inside the cabinet to distribute power and also used velcro to keep all the components on the floor of the cabinet. Control Panel Audio The Audio parts were all recycled. I used an old IPod dock as the amp (It takes audio in as well as the old style) and then wired these into some speakers i took from an old hello Kitty cd radio. Worked great and the old thing i had to buy were grills for the outside of the cabinet. THese cover the outlets I drilled in with a hole saw. The speakers are mounted on the inside just using some nail in cable clips. Marquee For the marquee (and Side art) I tried to find something that suited the size of the cabinet. I originally planned space invaders (as per the sketchup) but I found the battlezone side art and marquee stickers pretty cheap on ebay so went with that. I really liked how it turned out. For teh lights I'm using a usb led strip that I cut down to size, and it links nicely with the laptop being powered on. And here is the completed product. Finished Software For software I'm using HyperSpin and RocketLaucher. I've got Mame and a number of consoles setup with a large number of games (thousands). In reality it's too many so i plan to revisit this and bring it back to a manageable amount. It will play mame and 16 bit consoles ok. Struggles to play PSX games, so i don't use it for that. Even in Mame it's struggling to play things like NeoGeo games for fbaburn works fine. Another issue I have is that it's very slow for a game to launch. Fine for me, but can be hard to explain to some of the younger family members. Future I'd like to put a better PC inside, so might look at a cheap panel interface and update this at some point.","title":"Mame Bartop Build"},{"location":"Arcade/MameBuild/#mame-bartop-build","text":"After initially building a control panel to test everything out, i wanted to build a bar top cab so i could play mame games.","title":"Mame Bartop Build"},{"location":"Arcade/MameBuild/#donor-laptop","text":"A Dell Vostro 1710 laptop provided the internals for the build and the cab was built around that.

I took the one with the failed monitor and cleaned it out, removing all the boards and cabling power supply (I think it was failed too). As I already had the custom built cab and some parts, my plan was to set this up as a Vertical cab including a stick & trackball in order to play simple vertical games and also things like centipede, missle command and ideally arkanoid as well. As it turns out Arkanoid isn't that easy to play with a trackball, or I haven't managed to get it tuned properly. Initial Setup As with the other cabs, I started with the control panel. I cut 4 blanks to use, and with this one I set it up with a stick, 3 buttons & 2 start/coin buttons + the trackball. I used the router to recess the ball's mount but it was a tight squeeze (I can't add bolts on the bottom without some extra work) but the layout works well in the cabinet. With the panel, cut and painted, it actually looked good. In terms of paint I just used a black spray gloss, but this was only to get things up and running. You can also see in the screen shots the vertically mounted monitor. I took some extra sheet wood I had (It's chipboard) to make a template and tryout holding the vertical monitor. Initially it's a dry fit with the monitor sitting there, but again is good enough to get things running. Rasberry Pi Vertical Image For an initial setup I wanted to use Raspberry Pi as I knew it could work with the trackball I was using. TODO - Trackball link TODO - Vertical Image link Terra Cresta One of my favorite games and the one I use to test out any mame install is terra Cresta. It was in a local shop near where my cousins lived and we played it regularly while I was younger. I'm not sure I have gotten any better at it, but when I saw a board on ebay for a reasonable amount I had to get it (alongside the Jamma adapter). At this stage I'm still using the LCD screen, so i have connected it to a CRT->HDMI Adapter (you can see at the back of the second image). Longer term I hope to switch this out for a Vertically mounted CRT. I've seen this done by Olly@8BitManshed for a 1943, So it might need some cab adjustments to fit it in.

I'll hopefully revisit the original hardware at another time.","title":"Initial Startup &amp; Failure"},{"location":"Arcade/Virtua-Racing/3.%20Building%20a%20USB%20Adapter%20for%20Hardware/","text":"Hardware <-> Computer Interface Research When i looked into how to interface the hardware I off course came across all the efforts of SailorSat on the various forums and lots of information on how to connect and setup Daytona Hardware to a computer. Luckily a lot of this work is compatible with the Virtua Racing hardware as well so I've been able to piggy back from that. Firstly I spend time looking at the connections and connectors in the back of the control panel. I decided to work at this point rather than back to the filter board as seems to be the case for most updates. This was to remain non destructive & also to allow me to work with just the control panel and not have to cart about the large metal cages (or remove the boards from them). Daytona USB Project I came across a couple of options for interfacing hardware. Some relied on cannabalising hardware but I found SailorSat's repos and Forum posts on how they were reading the data using Arduino & Teensey2 boards. Arcade Controls - Daytona USA - Converting a Twin cabinet \"correctly\" https://github.com/SailorSat/daytona-utils This project is also the main reason I started to use DaytonaUSA as a test bed rather than Virtua Racing. It seemed easier to get the 2 players going together (Although there are also updates to virtua Racing on that side too) Teensey2++ I decided to go with Teensey option rather than Arduino Mega, as I already had one and it seemed a lot simpler. Building the bread board & Protoboard Using Schematics & Photos on the Forum posts, I put together a simple prototypes initially. I setup LEDS, buttons and potentiaometers in place of the console to test initially. Once I was happy that the firmware worked and I could do some basic controls, I moved the setup to a protoboard for something a little more permanent. Testing Daughter boards As part of this work, i also created 4 daughter boards to us in testing. - LED output - 4+ Controller Button - 3 Potentiometers (Steer, Accelerator+Brake) - Feedback Output Display More Info TBD Firmware At this stage I'm still on a more or less stock firmware from SailorSat, but I do have to make some changes to better support the Virtua Racing Paddle shifting.
