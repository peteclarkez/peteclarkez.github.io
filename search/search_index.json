Donor Laptop A Dell Vostro 1710 laptop provided the internals for the build and the cab was built around that. It provided the core dimensions. It's a Core 2 Duo with 4 GB of RAM and an Intel Integrated Video Card. Image below shows some early experiments in order to make sure I could power the laptop on and off from an external button. I had always planned to detach the screen and body, but once I got it open, there wasn't much length to the cable joining the 2 halfs, although the screen itself had some very useful mounting holes which take a 3.5mm bolt. This was how i mounted it to the front panel. In the end it was relatively simple and the board had some nice large contacts I could use to attach the wires for a normal arcade button. Cabinet Once I had a width I looked at the cabinet. I went with a width of 500mm and I built a test Control panel to make sure it was enough for 2 players. (Now painted bright yellow and refitted with some cheap buttons and a an internal raspberry pi) I got the layout from here << INSERT LINK >> I used Google sketchup to plan the build and started into it back in 2013. It was easy to build the unit but once I got to that stage I got stuck on how to mount a monitor to a front panel. (and left this for about 4 years continuely moving this around the garage) Eventually I got a head of steam up to tackle this and spend some time on the software getting the laptop up and running. I also went for the front panel, using 9mm MDF and routing out the opening using paper templates. I also worked out a way to mount the laptop within the cabinet keeping it close to the screen. I used 2 cross bars and the insert removed on the 9mm panel to creat an angled shelf to hold the laptop so the cable would reach. I attached velco patches to the laptop and shelf and this is all tha'ts need to keep it in place. With the plan all done, i got to priming and paint the cabinet. I went for a gray base primer all over to keep dust down and then applied black glass spray paint up in a number of layers with sanding in between. I had toyed with tmolding, but my router has an 8mm socket (got it second hand and think it came from aldi) so not easy to find a suitable slot cutter. In hindsight I wish I'd at least routed a bevel on the side panels. At this stage it was easy to start assembling the cabinet. I sued a 4 gang inside the cabinet to distribute power and also used velco to keep all the components on the floor of the cabinet. Control Panel Audio The Audio parts were all recycled. I used an old IPod dock as the amp (It takes audio in as well as the old style) and then wired these into some speakers i took from an old hello Kitty cd radio. Worked great and the old thing i had to buy were grills for the outside of the cabinet. THese cover the outlets I drilled in with a hole saw. The speakers are mounted on the inside just using some nail in cable clips. Marquee For the marquee (and Side art) I tried to find something that suited the size of the cabinet. I originally planned space invaders (as per the sketchup) but I found the battlezone side art and marquee stickers pretty cheap on ebay so went wit thtat. I really liked how it turned out. For teh lights I'm using a usb led strip that I cut down to size, and it links nicely with the laptop being powered on. And here is the completed product. Finished Software For software I'm using HyperSpin and RocketLaucher. I've got Mame and a number of consoles setup with a large number of games (thousands). In reality it's too many so i plan to revist this and bring it back to a managable amount. It will play mame and 16 bit consoles ok. Struggles to play PSX games, so i don't use it for that. Even in Mame it's stuggling to play things like NeoGeo games for fbaburn works fine. Another issue I have is that it's very slow for a game to launch. Fine for me, but can be hard to explain to some of the younger family members. Future I'd like to put a better PC inside, so might look at a cheap panel interface and update this at some point.","title":"Mame Bartop Build"},{"location":"Arcade/MameBuild/#mame-bartop-build","text":"After initially building a control panel to test everything out, i wanted to build a bar top cab so i could play mame games.","title":"Mame Bartop Build"},{"location":"Arcade/MameBuild/#donor-laptop","text":"A Dell Vostro 1710 laptop provided the internals for the build and the cab was built around that.

Mostly it was Noraut Pokers but there was also a Virtua Racing Cabinet. It was 6 miles from the house so I had a look and ended up taking it home. The Monitors had been stored locally but the back section was stored somewhere else. In general there was a lot of surface rust on the metal parts but for it's age and how it was stored it wasn't too bad. I knew it was biting of more than I should, but it was too close to pass. It was untested, which as always means not working. Initial look When I got this back home I initially had a look aroud the cabinet. The front part seems to have been stored relatively well and was in pretty good condition. The back end was in worse condition, the trim was falling off and some of the boards were in pretty bad condition. The Exteriour artwork was largely covered in perspex so it's also in pretty good condition. Need to make a choice whether to leave the perspex, remove it or replace it. Internals Pic Notes IO Board The IO and Audio boards on the top part of the back box seem to be in pretty good condition. A little dust where the io boards were enclosed. Audio Board CPU Board 1 The board in the lower part of the box were slightly worse, little more dirt and grime. CPU Board 2 Mold The underside of the IO boards was covered in a nasty white mold. Gave it a clean with some bleach and a brush and this kept it away so far. Seen another refurb who gave this a fresh coat of red paint so will likely give that go PSU Enclosure Both the PSU enclosures seemed to be prety full of dust and dirt. Must have been some damp in there too as the boards and connections are all pretty rusted and I'll share later where the audio amps are losing components.

It's in way better condition than the rear boards. The transformer. It let me down :( Monitors One of the first things I did was to disconnect the monitors since they were likely to fail.
